## Intro
This document will go through three different data structures and how you might use them in different scenarios. I will talk about [Stack](stack.md), [Set](set.md), and [Tree](tree.md) and some of their strengths and their weaknesses along with some of their build in functions. I will give a coding example on how to use each of these in a scenario and a little practice problem that you can follow at the end.
